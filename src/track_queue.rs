// Queue should play tracks in order, and

// struct Queue {
//     tracks: Vec<Track>,
// }

// When we click play on a song, it should start to play it

//

// There should be different priority levels for playing tracks

// Highest priority is when you click on a track to play it

// Next any songs that you have queued up to play

// Finally if you were playing any playlist, it should play the next song in the playlist
// until the playlist is over

// If there is nothing else to play, stop the sink.
