Rustify is an innovative, cross-platform audio player built with the Rust programming language, designed to offer a seamless and intuitive experience for managing and playing your audio files. Leveraging Rust's powerful performance and safety features, Rustify brings an efficient and reliable audio playback solution to your desktop environment.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Rustify is designed from the ground up to be fully functional on Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing a consistent user experience across all major operating systems.
  
- **Concurrency and Multithreading**: At its core, Rustify utilizes advanced concurrency and multithreading techniques to ensure audio playback is smooth and uninterrupted, while still maintaining a responsive user interface. This is achieved through Rust's safe concurrency model, ensuring thread safety and efficient handling of shared states.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: With an emphasis on usability, Rustify features a clean and straightforward graphical user interface (GUI) built with Egui. This ensures users can easily navigate their audio library, control playback, and access settings without unnecessary complexity.

- **Advanced Audio Processing**: Rustify supports a wide range of audio formats, thanks to its integration with the Rodio audio processing library. Users can enjoy high-quality playback of their favorite music and audio files, with support for various codecs and file types.

- **Playlist Management**: Organize your music collection with ease. Rustify allows users to create, edit, and manage playlists directly within the application, providing a flexible way to enjoy your music according to your mood, occasion, or preference.
