## Notes

![Rustify](https://github.com/landerwells/Rustify/blob/master/assets/rustify.png?raw=true)
Need to work on the play pause functionality paired with the track progress bar
as there are some bugs making them desync


all of the methods that will have to interact with the track progress states


play
playsong
pause
setprogress
getprogress



current goals,

refactor the audio thread
split into seperate files if it helps
